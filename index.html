        <h2>A SHORT INTERACTIVE STORY *</h2>
        <p>
          You are a developer in a country far far away. You're skilled, but the job search is slow. You sit at your
          desk, gazing into the night sky and wonder... Where did it all go wrong.

        After closing your laptop for the night, you pick up a few of your favorite IPA's from the supermarket. They
        do their work and while watching Tiger King you fall into a deep deep sleep on your couch.
        <strong>When you wake up you are in:</strong>

            <p>
              It's hot and desolated, the sun burns in the sky and you quickly take of your clothes. Confused you
              look around and think:

              <quote>"What happened to me..?"</quote>
              You try to think of what might possibly have led you to this place. Where the IPA's laced? Did someone
              kidnap you..? You're starting to get thirsty and decide to find help.
              <strong>You start walking:</strong>
            </p>

            <details>
              <summary class="btn">East</summary>

                  <p>
                    You start walking East but after a few hours there's still nothing in sight. Your flipflops are
                    starting to melt due to the hot sand and your mouth is as dry as the Sahara.

                          You keep pushing on and are about to collapse from thirst when you see something in the
                          distance.
                          <quote>"Is it a oasis, could it really be? Am I saved..?"</quote>
                          You run towards it and drink from the water. After you've quenched your thirst you turn
                          around and..

                          <strong>You see:</strong>

                                The snake looks at you like the HR manager from the previous company and hisses
                                Linux commands at you.
                                <code>$ rm -rf , $ ln -s my_file.txt my_link.txt </code>
                                You're confused but also feel a need to take it with you.

                                <strong>What do you do?</strong>

                                      You pick up the snake. It trusts you completely and hisses soft Linux commands
                                      while you walk towards the cave.

                                            There's a old door with a sign above it, it reads "BASH". Pretty weird

                                                  The snake starts hissing Linux commands at the door. Slowly the
                                                  door opens. It's dark inside and cool air flows through the cave.

                                            There's a old door with a sign above it, it reads "VSCODE". Pretty weird

                                                  The cat starts meowing CSS properties at the door. Slowly the door
                                                  opens. It's dark inside and cool air flows through the cave.

                                  paddling as hard as you can to reach the shore but it's too late.

                                  As you get closer it appears to be abandoned. Your hopes of getting saved are
                                  crushed, but still decide to have a look

                                        It's a large village, but the houses are already decaying. It reminds you of
                                        the good times at your previous job and you shed a tear. It's a shame they
                                        didn't give you a chance to learn the new stuff.

                                        This is something you must keep reminding yourself about. Without hope for a
                                        new job you just might as well start flipping burgers. Then all of a sudden

                                              countless small houses.

                                              comfortable. When you sit down the square fills with fog.
